# Red Zebra

Hi there! This is Red Zebra - very simple text editor for iOS.
It is heavily inspired by both GNU's NANO text editor and louisdh's Textor.

It's not meant to be a feature complete IDE, with fancy features and stuff...
Just a simple tool that you use when you're away from your computer and need to review some code or
update some variable value or what have you...

It's nothing serious and I'm a total noob, so don't judge! :D
