Hi there! This is Red Zebra - very simple text editor for iOS.
It is heavily inspired by both [GNU's NANO](https://www.nano-editor.org) text editor and [louisdh's Textor](https://github.com/louisdh/textor).

It's not meant to be a feature complete IDE, with fancy features and stuff...
Just a simple tool that you use when you're away from your computer and need to review some code or
update some variable value or what have you...

If you are willing to become a [beta tester](https://testflight.apple.com/join/ru9BvuJe), thank you!!!

### Branches:

**Master** is the branch where all the new development is happening & it's version number should be close to the public beta.

The version that is on App Store is the "latest non-master branch" - for example: if there is branch named "**1.2.9**", that's the version that you can find on the App Store.
**Master** is most likely a little bit ahead of the App Store version - given our example probably something like 1.3 or 1.2.10.
