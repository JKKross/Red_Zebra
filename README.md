# Red Zebra

Hi there! This is Red Zebra - very simple text editor for iOS.
It is heavily inspired by both [GNU's NANO](https://www.nano-editor.org) text editor and [louisdh's Textor](https://github.com/louisdh/textor).

It's not meant to be a feature complete IDE, with fancy features and stuff...
Just a simple tool that you use when you're away from your computer and need to review some code or
update some variable value or what have you...

Have to admit, it's full of hacky solutions - but it works...
It's nothing serious and I'm a total noob, so don't judge! :D
