Hi there! This is Red Zebra - very simple text editor for iOS.
It is heavily inspired by both [GNU's NANO](https://www.nano-editor.org) text editor and [louisdh's Textor](https://github.com/louisdh/textor).

It's not meant to be a feature complete IDE, with fancy features and stuff...
Just a simple tool that you use when you're away from your computer and need to review some code or
update some variable value or what have you...
