<h1 align="center">Red Zebra</h1>

This is the in-development branch of Red Zebra with experiments/upcoming features.
If you're looking for the stable version (that you can [download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/red-zebra/id1463017929?l=cs&ls=1&mt=8)), that's on branch [**master**](https://github.com/JKKross/Red_Zebra/tree/master).

If youâ€™re willing to help with [beta testing](https://testflight.apple.com/join/ru9BvuJe),  thank you!!!
